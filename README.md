# IWBTG-C-Engine
A simple IWBTG fangame engine written in C. As per usual, since this is just me playing around and testing some stuff, the game code is a giant mess that is almost entirely in the main.c file. I'll tidy it all up if I decide to continue this project.

I've tried to match the current fangame engines that other people have made as closely as possible with a locked 50fps framerate and the same movement constants, etc.
