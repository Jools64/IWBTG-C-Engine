# I Wanna Be The Guy C Engine
An "I Wanna Be The Guy" engine written in C. As per usual, since this is just me playing around and testing some stuff, most of the code is quite messy and thrown together. I might decide to tidy it up if I continue this project.

The engine attempts to emulate the standard movement of IWBTG fangames. This is why the framerate is locked to 50 and the movement is heavily tied to the framerate. Almost all player movement constants have been taken from existing engines for as close to frame for frame accuracy as possible. Some things have been adjusted however such as hitboxes.

# Dependencies
Requires SDL2, SDL2_Image and SDL2_Mixer

# Binaries
I will make some of these availible when the project is closer to being finished.
